# MAFAT-Radar-Challenge
In this competition, MAFATâ€™s DDR&amp;D (Directorate of Defense Research &amp; Development) would like to tackle the challenge of classifying living, non-rigid objects detected by doppler-pulse radar systems. More info here: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/25389 

NOTE: This work was completed in conjunction with GSI Technology and George Williams. I have included a copy here for a public example of how we used TSNE's, this work is part of a blog which can be found here: https://medium.com/@bdriggs/training-a-model-to-use-doppler-pulse-radar-for-target-classification-2944a312148c
